Hi, my name is Tae Eun.
I am a first-year Ph.D student at KAIST.
I am greatful to be advised by [Prof. Kihong Heo](https://kihongheo.kaist.ac.kr/).
My current research interests are in the intersection of Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis, which are each represented as Program Analysis and Fuzzing, respectively.
